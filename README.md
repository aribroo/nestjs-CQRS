# NestJS CQRS Project

This repository contains a project built with NestJS, a powerful Node.js framework, focusing on Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS) architecture pattern. The CQRS pattern emphasizes the separation of concerns between command-side operations (writing data) and query-side operations (reading data), resulting in a more scalable and maintainable application.

## Features

- **Command Handling:** Implementations for handling commands, which are actions that change the state of the application.
- **Query Handling:** Implementations for handling queries, which are actions that retrieve data from the application.
- **Event Sourcing:** Utilization of event sourcing for storing the history of state-changing events in the application.
- **Domain-Driven Design (DDD):** Structuring of the application based on domain concepts and business logic.
- **Event Bus:** Integration of an event bus for facilitating communication between different parts of the application.
- **Middleware:** Middleware implementations for intercepting and processing incoming requests.
